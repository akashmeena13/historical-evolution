<body> <h1>Evolution of the universe</h1>
    <h2>1. The Big Bang (13.8 billion years ago)</h2>
    <h3>The evolution of the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a monumental event that marked the birth of space, time, and all matter. This wasn't an explosion in space, but rather an expansion of space itself from a state of infinite density and temperature, known as a singularity.

        At the instant of the Big Bang:
        
        The universe was extremely hot and dense, composed primarily of energy.
        All fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force) were unified.</h3>
        <h2>2. Planck Epoch (10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang)</h2>
        <h3>This is the earliest known period of the universe's history, where conditions were so extreme that our current understanding of physics (General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics) cannot fully explain it.

            During this time, gravity separated from the other fundamental forces.
            The universe continued to expand rapidly, but no distinct particles had yet formed.</h3>
            <h2>3. Grand Unification Epoch (10^-36 to 10^-32 seconds)</h2>
            <h3>As the universe cooled, the strong nuclear force separated from the other forces, leaving electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force unified.

                High-energy phenomena dominated, and basic particles began to emerge.
                Cosmic inflation occurred during this epoch—a brief but exponential expansion of the universe. Inflation helps explain the uniformity of the cosmos.</h3>
                <h2>4. Electroweak Epoch (10^-32 to 10^-12 seconds)</h2>
                <h3>As the universe cooled further:

                    The weak nuclear force and electromagnetism became distinct forces.
                    The first quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons (which mediate forces) began to form.</h3>
                    <h2>5. Quark Epoch (10^-12 to 10^-6 seconds) </h2>
                    <h3>This period saw the universe dominated by quarks, gluons, and other fundamental particles. Due to the high temperatures, quarks couldn’t combine to form hadrons (protons and neutrons) yet.

                        The universe was like a hot "quark-gluon plasma."</h3>
                        <h2>6. Hadron Epoch (10^-6 to 1 second)
                        </h2>
                        <h3>As the universe cooled below 1 trillion degrees, quarks were able to combine, forming protons and neutrons (hadrons).

                            Matter began to dominate over antimatter, though the exact reason for this asymmetry is still a mystery.</h3>
                            <h2>7. Lepton Epoch (1 second to 10 seconds)</h2>
                            <h3>Leptons (electrons, neutrinos, and their antiparticles) dominated the universe at this time.

                                The universe continued to cool and expand, allowing neutrons and protons to begin forming the first atomic nuclei.</h3>
                                <h2>8. Nucleosynthesis (3 minutes to 20 minutes)</h2>
                                <h3>During this period, also known as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis:

                                    Light elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and small amounts of lithium and beryllium, were formed.
                                    The temperatures dropped to a point where nuclear fusion could occur, fusing protons and neutrons together to form these nuclei.
                                    This process produced the elemental abundance we see today: ~75% hydrogen, ~25% helium, with traces of lithium and other light elements.</h3>
                                    <h2>9. Photon Epoch (10 seconds to 370,000 years)</h2>
                                    <h3>For the next 370,000 years, the universe was filled with a plasma of electrons and nuclei. Photons (light particles) were constantly scattered by free electrons, making the universe opaque.

                                        The universe continued to expand and cool.
                                        Around 370,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped enough for electrons to combine with nuclei, forming neutral atoms. This event is called recombination.</h3>
                                        <h2>10. Recombination and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
                                        </h2>
                                        <h3>With the formation of neutral atoms, photons could finally travel freely through space. These photons still exist today as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which we observe as the afterglow of the Big Bang. The CMB provides a snapshot of the universe when it was just 380,000 years old.

                                            The universe became transparent for the first time, and the CMB radiation began its journey across the cosmos.</h3>
